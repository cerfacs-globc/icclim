icclim continuous integration (CI) aims to assist development by:
   -  Avoiding introducing bugs in the code base.
   -  Ensuring all new code follow the same code style.
   -  Measuring how much icclim code base is tested by automated unit
      tests. This is known as code coverage.
   -  Making sure the documentation generation is functioning well.

These goals are reached using multiple tools:
   -  pre-commit CI enforce the code style (Black + flake8 + isort) is
      followed by committing changes directly on new pull request and
      blocking merge if necessary. The relevant file is
      `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

   -  readthedocs, which serve our documentation is also configured to
      run the documentation generation on each new pull request.

   -  github actions are used to run unit tests and report the results
      in each pull request.
