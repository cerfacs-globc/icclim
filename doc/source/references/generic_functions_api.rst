Generic indices/indicators
==========================

icclim 6.0 introduced the concept of generic indices.
This document present the auto-generated functions that were built base on :py:class:`icclim.generic_indices.GenericIndicatorRegistry`.
The are accessible directly from `icclim` namespace.

As an example, you can compute the number of days where a threshold is reached with:

.. code-block:: python

    import glob
    import icclim

    hot_days_ds = icclim.count_occurrences(
        in_files="netcdf_files/data*.nc",
        var_name=["tmax"],
        threshold="> 27 degree_Celsius",
    )

For more details on threshold and how to personalize them, see :ref:`threshold` documentation.
We also prepared a few examples on :ref:`generic_indices_recipes` so that you get an idea of the capabilities of
these generic indices.
