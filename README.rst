icclim is a Python library to compute climate indices.
icclim name stands for index, calculation, climate.

Installation
------------

From pypi: ``pip install icclim``.

From conda-forge: ``conda install -c conda-forge icclim``.

From sources:
    - Clone the repository ``git clone https://github.com/cerfacs-globc/icclim.git``
    - Install icclim ``pip install .``

How to use icclim
-----------------

Let's count the number of days above 25Â°C for each year, which corresponds to the index ``SU``, from a `tasmax` variable scattered in multiple netcdf files.

`SU` is one of the many index that can be computed with icclim. See `the documentation <https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/climate_indices.html#icclim-capabilities>`_ to explore what other index you can compute with icclim.

.. code-block:: python

    import icclim

    summer_days = icclim.su(
        "netcdf_files/tasmax_1990-2100.nc", out_file="summer_days.nc"
    )

For more examples on how to use icclim, see icclim's `How to ... <https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/index.html>`_ documentation or
`our notebooks <https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html>`_.


Who use icclim
--------------

icclim is part of `C4I platform <https://dev.climate4impact.eu>`_ backend and is integrated in `CLIPC Portal <http://www.clipc.eu>`_.
icclim is also used by some independent researchers.


Who made icclim
---------------

icclim has always been an open source project and was successfully made thanks to the joint effort of all its contributors.
The lead development is made at `CERFACS <https://cerfacs.fr/en/>`_, a research institution located in Toulouse, France.
